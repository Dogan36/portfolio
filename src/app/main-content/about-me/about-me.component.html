            <p translate>Hello, nice to meet you! I'm DoÄŸan, a German-speaking frontend developer based in Munich with
                experience in building web applications using JavaScript & Angular. I've worked on projects
                independently and within teams, always adhering to the principles of clean code.</p>

                <p translate>The breadth of possibilities in programming captivates me. Building projects from the
                    ground up and experiencing the sense of accomplishment upon completion are aspects I truly enjoy. I
                    am currently on the lookout for an opportunity to demonstrate my skills as a junior frontend
                    developer.</p>

                <p translate>I am thrilled to have discovered my place in the programming world, and now I am eager to
                    become a part of a fantastic team. My aim is continuous learning and growth. I am highly motivated
                    and excited to overcome new challenges and learn from them every day.</p>
