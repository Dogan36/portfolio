        <p translate>At the Developer Akademie, I gained hands-on experience in building modern web applications from the ground up. I work confidently across frontend and backend, develop scalable APIs, deploy applications to the cloud, and always focus on clean, high-performance code. Whether it's version control with Git, responsive design, testing, or deployment â€“ I'm familiar with the tools that matter and approach tasks in a structured, solution-oriented way. I'm continuously expanding my technical knowledge with the goal of building reliable applications that perform in real-world scenarios.</p>
